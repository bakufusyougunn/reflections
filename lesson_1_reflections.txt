Q: How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
A: I can debug more quickly.

Q: What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
A: If you decide to manually choose when to create a commit, you may forget. You may also make a too big commit or too small commit. You must spend some time to creat a proper commit. But that's worthy.

Q: Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
A: In some situations, multiples files relate to each other.

Q: How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
A: I can't get what I want, I don't know why.

Q: How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
A: Now I can make some changes without worrying about break the main code.

Q: Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
