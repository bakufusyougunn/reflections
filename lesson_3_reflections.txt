Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: If I want to collaborate with someone on a project, I can use a remote to share the local commit history.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Just like Git let you decide when to submit a commit, GitHub think you are exactly the person who knows when to pull the changes. And you decide whether or not to pull the changes.

Q: Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
A: Branches happen in my local repository, when I want to work on some experimental features, I can use branch. Clones happen both on local computer and GitHub. Forks only happen on GitHub. If I can't make changes on some repository, I can use fork.

Q: What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
A: Everyone can make changes without worrying about merging problem.

Q: How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
A: I can collaborate with others using Git or GitHub, this makes my work more easier.

Q: When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?
A: Althoug working directly in master can be easier than create a new branch, but if I'm want to listen the feedback from my friend, I will make changes in a branch and make a pull request.
