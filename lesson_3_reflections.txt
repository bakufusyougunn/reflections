Q: When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
A: If I want to collaborate with someone on a project, I can use a remote to share the local commit history.

Q: Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
A: Just like Git let you decide when to submit a commit, GitHub think you are exactly the person who knows when to pull the changes. And you decide whether or not to pull the changes.
